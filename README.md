# Project 1 Requirements

coding project(s) for web design and page management


Our ongoing success with HTML has encouraged us to continue showing off our developing skills.  Please be sure to include the following elements in your Project 1 submission:

- A frame set with a menu frame on the left and a display frame on the right.
- In the menu frame, include an internal style sheet for the unique style of the menu.
- Include an external style sheet for all other documents and have them link to it.
- In your resume document, include at least three targets (i.e. top, skills, objective) and links to navigate to them.
- make a "Contact Us" page and include an e-mail link (hint: mailto:).
 
Of course, you still need to include all the requirements from our SU4S submission:
- At least three levels of pre-formatted style headings (i.e. h1, h2, h3).
- Use both bold and italics text styling.
- Include at least one image.
- Use a horizontal rule (`<hr>`).
- Create a second page and make a link to it, and a link back.
- Include at least on link to another web site.
- Create a table (with a border so it's easy to see).
- As always, these are the minimum requirements.  Obviosly, you can do more if you choose.  Have fun!
